# doubleword
`doubleword` is a 32-bit fantasy computer architecture, created as a hobby project, for the experience of designing and writing various components - including an emulator, assembler, and multitasking operating system.

# project structure
Each subfolder under the `/src` directory is its own project within this repository. As such, they all contain their own READMEs and build scripts. 
The source code can be found under the `/src` directory, and information on how the system functions and how to write programs for it can be found under the `/doc` directory. The `/bin` directory contains the compiled emulator program, as well as several precompiled binaries to run under the emulator.
